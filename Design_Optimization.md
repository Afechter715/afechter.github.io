title: Design Optimization
---

To better understand the system, optimization methods were used to determine the force nessecary to support the load of the system. This was done by allowing the torque applied to be variable. Then, bounds were set that limited the amount of torque that could be applied. Below is the final animation after the optimization. Additionally, the previous dynamics model animation is located below for reference.
