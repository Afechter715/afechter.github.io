## Introduction

Foldable robotic systems creates a new opportunity to manufacture mechanisms that have not been possible. This project focuses on mimicing the human calf muscle to allow control  of the heel angle while running.

## Research Question

How can we design an elemental artificial muscle using foldable robotics techniques that can produce the same biomechanical properties as that involved in legged motion of land based vertebrates?
