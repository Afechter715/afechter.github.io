Manufacturing was started by converting the design into a DXF file. This was done using Draftsight to create multiple layers that pertain to certain features.

The prototype model was constructed from 1/4" birch wood sheet, paper, and wood glue. 

The test joint was weighed so that accurate perdictions could be made withing the modeling and optimization processes.

The layers were constructed and a 10 lbs weight was used to apply pressure while the wood glue dried. This was repeated for each link until complete.
