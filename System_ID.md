title: System Identification

The goal of the System Identification Assignment was to determine the damping ratio of a standard joint. To do this, a test joint was constructed from the avaliable materials and a simple joint was created. A pendulum test setup was used to create basic motion as shown below:

The motion was then recorded in slow motion and analyzed in the tracker software. From this, a damped sine wave was generate with a damping value that was used in the dynamics model.
